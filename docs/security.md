# Security Threat Model: Subscription Vault Contract

## Overview

This document consolidates the overarching security assumptions, threat models, and corresponding mitigations for the Stellabill Subscription Vault smart contract on the Soroban network. It aggregates the deep-dives found in `docs/reentrancy.md`, `docs/replay_protection.md`, and `docs/safe_math.md` into a single, concise threat matrix mapping directly to contract functions and tests.

## 1. Threat Model Assumptions

### Trusted Actors
- **Admin**: Operates with High trust. Responsible for charging subscriptions and setting parameters (e.g., `min_topup`). Represents a single point of failure.
- **Soroban Runtime**: Trusted to securely execute WebAssembly, enforce authentication (`require_auth()`), and manage state natively.
- **USDC Token Contract**: Trusted to implement the Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) correctly without malicious arbitrary callbacks.

### Semi & Untrusted Actors
- **Subscribers (Semi-Trusted)**: Can deposit funds and manage their own subscriptions but might attempt state manipulations to avoid charges.
- **Merchants (Semi-Trusted)**: Can withdraw earned balances but might attempt to over-withdraw or exploit cross-subscription data.
- **External Attackers (Untrusted)**: May probe the contract for reentrancy, overflow, or state-bypass vulnerabilities.

## 2. Threat Categories & Mitigation Mapping

| Threat Category | Risk Description | Implemented Mitigations | Associated Functions | Test Coverage Verification |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Unauthorized Access** | Attackers or unauthorized users performing state-changing actions. | Shared admin guards plus explicit subscriber/merchant ownership checks. Admin-only routes return `Unauthorized` for wrong or stale admins, while ownership-gated non-admin routes use `Forbidden` where appropriate. | `set_min_topup`, `rotate_admin`, `recover_stranded_funds`, token registry, emergency controls, export endpoints, billing/oracle maintenance, `partial_refund`, `set_subscriber_credit_limit`, `remove_from_blocklist` | `test_admin_authorization_matrix_rejects_non_admin_across_protected_entrypoints`, `test_admin_authorization_matrix_rejects_stale_admin_after_rotation`, `test_rotate_admin_unauthorized`, `test_partial_refund_rejects_invalid_amounts_and_auth` |
| **Reentrancy (Callbacks)** | Malicious token contracts or other external calls triggering recursive execution to drain funds or bypass state updates. | Strict adherence to the **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** pattern. Internal balances are updated in storage *before* any `token.transfer()` occurs. Optional runtime locks (`reentrancy.rs`) are available. | `do_deposit_funds`, `withdraw_merchant_funds`, `do_withdraw_subscriber_funds` | `test_deposit_funds_state_committed_before_transfer`, `test_withdraw_merchant_funds_state_committed_before_transfer`, `test_reentrancy_lock_prevents_recursive_calls` |
| **Replay & Double Charging** | Re-executing a charge transaction within the same period to debit a subscriber multiple times. | Period-based tracking (`now >= last_payment_timestamp + interval_seconds`) ensures single deduction per interval. Deduplication relies on `idempotency_key` handling for retries without double-debits (`Error::Replay`). | `charge_subscription`, `batch_charge` | `test_charge_succeeds_at_exact_interval`, `test_immediate_retry_at_same_timestamp_rejected`, `test_replay_protection_on_batch_charge` |
| **Arithmetic Risks** | Integer overflow or underflow leading to incorrect balances or state corruption. | Explicit use of Rust's checked arithmetic wrappers (`safe_add`, `safe_sub`) returning explicit `Error::Overflow` (500) and `Error::Underflow` (501). Prevents any silent wraparound or negative balances. | `safe_add_balance`, `safe_sub_balance`, `charge_one` | `test_safe_add_overflow_returns_error`, `test_safe_sub_underflow_returns_error`, `test_charge_amount_greater_than_balance_fails` |
| **State Machine Bypass** | Forcing a subscription into an invalid state (e.g., Active to Paused without proper authorization). | Centralized validation via `validate_status_transition`. Subscriptions locked once `Cancelled`. Illegal state jumping yields `Error::InvalidStatusTransition`. | `validate_status_transition`, `do_cancel_subscription`, `do_pause_subscription` | `test_all_valid_transitions_coverage`, `test_invalid_cancelled_to_active`, `test_validate_cancelled_transitions_all_blocked` |
| **ID Collision / Overflow** | Reaching the maximum subscription ID and wrapping around to overwrite existing data. | Monotonically increasing, atomic `next_id` counter bounded to `u32::MAX`. | `next_id`, `create_subscription` | `test_subscription_limit_reached` |

## 3. Security Regression Pack

The Security Regression Pack (found in `src/test_security.rs`) consolidates critical safety checks to ensure no regressions are introduced during future development. It is grouped into four primary risk classes:

### Risk Class 1: Reentrancy & Flow Control
- **Negative Test**: Verify that a recursive call to `withdraw_merchant_funds` is blocked by the `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **Consistency Test**: Ensure all state updates (e.g., balance decrements) occur *before* external token transfers.

### Risk Class 2: Authorization & Ownership
- **Negative Test**: Attempt to pause or cancel a subscription using a "stranger" address (neither subscriber nor merchant).
- **Negative Test**: Verify the full admin authorization matrix, including stale-admin rejection after rotation and deterministic `Unauthorized` responses across admin-only routes.

### Risk Class 3: Replay & Idempotency
- **Negative Test**: Attempt to charge the same subscription twice within the same ledger timestamp.
- **Negative Test**: Verify that `batch_charge` deduplicates redundant IDs within a single call.

### Risk Class 4: Arithmetic Bounds
- **Edge Case Test**: Verify that charging a subscription with exactly `amount` leaves the balance at zero.
- **Negative Test**: Attempt to `deposit_funds` with a negative amount (underflow protection).
- **Negative Test**: Verify that `safe_add` correctly returns `Error::Overflow` at `i128::MAX`.

## 4. Known Limitations and Future Hardening

While the current architecture rigorously applies the CEI pattern and strict arithmetic bounds, the following systemic risks represent known limitations slated for future mitigation:

1. **Admin Key Compromise**: 
   - *Risk*: A compromised admin key can force global charges or manipulate thresholds continuously.
   - *Future Hardening*: Transition to multi-signature structures or time-locked upgrades for critical controls.
2. **Storage Exhaustion (DoS)**: 
   - *Risk*: An attacker with valid signatures can spam `create_subscription` indefinitely, inflating ledger footprint arbitrarily.
   - *Future Hardening*: Introduce minimal initial deposit requirements, per-subscriber creation limits, and archival functions.
3. **Stored-admin-only batch charging**:
   - *Risk*: `batch_charge` authenticates against the stored admin without an explicit caller parameter, so unauthorized attempts fail at the Soroban host auth layer rather than with a contract `Unauthorized` code.
   - *Future Hardening*: Preserve this intentionally if the API should stay parameterless; otherwise introduce an explicit admin argument and keep it on the shared guard path.
4. **Admin key operational centralization**:
   - *Risk*: Admin rotation removes stale access immediately, but the system still depends on one operational control plane.
   - *Future Hardening*: Multi-sig admin rotation, hardware-backed signing, and incident runbooks for emergency-stop usage.
